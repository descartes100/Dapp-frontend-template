# A Dapp frontend template built with Next.js + RainbowKit + WAGMI to help developers interact with their contracts in an easy way.

## Tools

1. [WAGMI](https://wagmi.sh/) - wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum.

2. [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction) - RainbowKit is a React library that makes it easy to add wallet connection to your dapp. It's intuitive, responsive and customizable.

# Installation

```
npm install
```

# Usage

```
npm run dev
```

# Customization

1. Change the contracts/contract.json file to the abi file of the contract you want to build with. 

2. Customize the contract calls in the pages/index.js. 

3. And then you can interact with your contract easily using the frontend you built!
